								<h3 align="center">Biography</h3>
							<p> Sing-Chun (Sally) Wang, Ph.D., obtained her bachelar of Biology and minor in Environmental Engineering and Earth Science from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Taiwan. Her strong interests in Enverionmental Sciences motivated her studies in Atmospheric Sciences. </p>

							<p> She obtained her doctoral degree in Atmospheric Science at University of Houston (UH), USA in May 2019. During her PhD study, she used GEOS-Chem model, satellite observations, and ground observations to study the transport patterns of Central American fires and to quantify the impact of the fires on Gulf Coast air quality. She also developed a machine learning model to predict burned area in the
							South Central US. The developed model is able to obtain higher prediction accuracy and to provide better understanding of wildfire mechanisms in the South Central US. </p>

							<p> From March 2020, Sally started working as a postdoctoral fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and her on-going research is to utilize machine learning techniques to better predict wildfire burned area and understand the major controls of fires in the continental US. </p>

							<h3 align="center">Research interests</h3>
							<p>The research goal of my studies is to better understand wildfire behavior and
							its impact. An increasing trend of intense wildfires associated with 
							severe drought under a warming climate has been reported by many studies. 
							Wildfires have led to poor air quality by emitting large amount of particles and ozone 
							precursor gases. Those pollutants can modify cloud properties, affect energy balance, 
							and further influence weather and climate. Thus, I am mainly interested in the interactions 
							among wildfires, air pollution, weather, and climate. </p>



							<h3 align="center">Fire smokes from Central America to US</h3>

							<p>Fire emissions from Mexico and Central America are transported regularly to the U.S. Gulf Coast every spring under prevailing circulation patterns and affect U.S. air quality. We used a GEOS-Chem passive tracer simulation to develop the climatology of transport pathways of fire emissions over a long-term time period of April and May, 2002-2015 and estimate their adverse air quality effects for urban areas along the Gulf Coast. Considering both transport and fire emissions, we identified approximately 9% of the study period (59-88 days of 854 days) were influenced by the Central American fire emissions. The impacts on surface air quality were found at several major urban centers along the Gulf Coast, including Houston and Corpus Christi in TX, New Orleans in LA, Mobile in AL, and Pensacola in FL. Compared to clean maritime flow from the Gulf of Mexico, these events were estimated to result in average enhancements of maximum daily average 8-hr (MDA8) ozone and daily PM2.5 in the Gulf Coast cities of 3-12 ppbv and 2-5 microgram/m3, respectively.</p>

							<h3 align="center">Wildfire model for South Central US</h3>

							<p>One common method to explain and investigate the relationship between wildfires and factors is regression, while most data-driven regression methods would favor the majority class (here referring to unburned or small-burned grids) in the unevenly-distributed data (wildfire burned area data), which would lead to underestimation of large fires. To solve this, we integrated multiple machine learning algorithms to develop a prediction model of 0.5 deg x0.5 deg -gridded monthly wildfire burned area over the South Central United States during 2002-2015 and then use this model to identify the relative importance of the environmental drivers on the burned area for both the winter-spring and summer fire seasons of that region.</p>

							<h3 align="center">A universal wildfire model for the continental US</h3>

							<p>Based on the knowledge and experience of wildfire models for the South Central US, I'm currently developing a machine learning model to estimate burned area of the Continental US. By utilizing the novel interpretation method, we're able to open the black box of machine learning model to better understand the leading factors controlling burned area for different regions of the US for future management, prevention/mitigation, and projection. </p>
